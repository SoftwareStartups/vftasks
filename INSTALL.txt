1 vfStream Installation
=======================

This file describes how to build the vfStream library on your local system.


2 Obtaining vfStream
====================

  1. Download vfStream archive from the Vector Fabrics website
     http://www.vectorfabrics.com/crm/vfstream.
     This requires an active account for any of the Vector Fabrics products.

  2. Unpack the vfStream archive in a local directory.
     $ gzip -cd vfstream-<version>.tar.gz | tar xf -
     $ cd vfstream-<version>


3 Prerequisites
===============

  * The GNU C compiler (gcc) is required. Alternative ANSI C compilers may be used but are not tested.

  * To build the source, the GNU Make system is used (http://www.gnu.org/software/make)

  * To compile and run the unit tests, the GNU C++ compiler (g++) or alternative ANSI C++ compiler is required.
    In addition, the CppUnit library is required (http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cppunit)

  * To build the (html) documentation from the sources, Doxygen is required (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen)

The build has been verified on Ubuntu 9.10 64 bits and 32 bits with gcc/g++ version 4.4.1, CppUnit version , and Doxygen 1.6.3

3.1 Debian/Ubuntu
-----------------

  * Install the following packages to build the sources:
    $ sudo apt-get install gcc libc-dev libc6-dev make

  * To build the unit test and documentation, install the following packages:
    $ sudo apt-get install g++ libcppunit-dev doxygen


4 Building vfStream
===================

  * Build vfstream:
    $ cd vfstream-<version>
    $ make vfstream

    The vfStream library is created in vfstream-<version>/vfstream/lib/<platform>/libvfstream.a
    The include files are located in vfstream-<version>/vfstream/include

  * Build and run the unit tests:
    $ make test

  * Build the html documentation:
    $ make doc
    
    The documentation is located under vfstream-<version>/doc/html/

  * Clean the object files with:
    $ make clean

    or to start from a clean distribution:
    $ make clean_all
